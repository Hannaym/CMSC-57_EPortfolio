        <h2>Counting....?</h2>
        <p>
          Counting is fundamental in mathematics and computer science. It's about figuring out "how many" ways an event can happen 
          — from arranging objects to calculating probabilities.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Before this lesson, I thought "counting" was just basic 1, 2, 3 (<i>joke hahaha</i>), was just basic math—listing things and totaling them. 
          But I learned that it’s actually a powerful tool for solving complex problems efficiently. I was surprised by how often counting techniques 
          show up in technology, games, and even daily decision-making. It made me appreciate the logic and structure behind things I took for granted.
          <br>This topic shows me a <i>different kind of counting</i>..... a difficult one.

        <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
        <p>How I understand and remember each topic...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Basic Counting Rules:</strong> Helped me understand how to calculate outcomes without listing every possibility.</li>
          <li><strong>Pigeonhole Principle:</strong> If there are more items than containers, at least one container must hold more than one item — a simple but powerful concept.</li>
          <li><strong>Permutations and Combinations:</strong> Taught me how order affects outcomes (permutations) and how to count groupings (combinations).</li>
          <li><strong>Generating Permutations/Combinations:</strong> Learned how the concept of permutation and combination generate number/digit to produce all possible outcomes. One of my favorite topic :)</li>
        </ul>

        <br><p>You can use...</p>
        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">🧮</span> <strong>Combinations</strong> - to calculate how many unique matches are needed since each player must face every other player once — <code>C(6, 2) = 15 matches</code>.</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">🔄</span> <strong>Permutations</strong> - to help determine how many ways the match order can be arranged if timing or priority matters.</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">📦</span> <strong>Pigeonhole Principle</strong> - in a scenario with only 5 available time slots and 15 matches, at least one slot must host multiple games.</li>
      </ul>
