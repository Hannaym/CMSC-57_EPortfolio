        <h2>What is Algebraic Structure?</h2>
        <p>
          Algebraic structures are foundational frameworks that define how sets and operations interact. They provide the language and rules 
          for manipulating abstract concepts such as groups, rings, and fields — which are vital in computer science, cryptography, and logic 
          systems.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          Initially, I found the term “algebraic structure” intimidating. I thought it would be purely symbolic or theoretical. But as I 
          learned how it is about sets, binary operations, plus how the properties like associativity or identity shape a structure, I 
          realized how practical and elegant these concepts are. From programming to puzzle solving, algebraic structures pop up in 
          unexpected ways, but still kinda confusing sometimes!

        Before this topic, I didn’t realize how often algebraic structures like groups or sets appear in real life. I used to think they 
        were just abstract math concepts, but now I see how they help explain patterns, rules, and systems—like in encryption, coding, or 
        even puzzle-solving. Learning about them gave me a new appreciation for the structure behind the logic we often take for granted.

        <h2>⏰Real-Life Example</h2>
        <p>Imagine trying to figure out what time it’ll be 9 hours after 8 PM. Using modular arithmetic (mod 12), you calculate (8 + 9) mod 12 = 5. 
          It’ll be 5 AM. The 12-hour clock is a natural algebraic structure we all use daily.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">⏰</span><strong>Clock Arithmetic:</strong> Our 12-hour and 24-hour clocks follow modular arithmetic, an algebraic system — think of time wraps like (9 + 5) mod 12 = 2.</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">🎨</span><strong>Patterns & Symmetry:</strong> Wallpaper and tiles use symmetry groups, a type of algebraic structure, to repeat designs consistently.</li>
          <li><span style="font-size: 1.2em;">🔐</span><strong>Passwords & Codes:</strong> Secure systems use group and field structures in encryption, ensuring only the right inputs give access.</li>
