        <h2>What is Discrete Probability?</h2>
        <p>
            Discrete probability is the study of events with a countable number of possible outcomes. It provides a 
            mathematical framework to measure uncertainty and predict the likelihood of different outcomes in situations 
            involving randomness. By assigning probabilities to each outcome in a defined sample space, we can analyze 
            and make informed decisions about uncertain events. This area forms the basis for understanding chance, risk, 
            and variability in various real-world and theoretical contexts.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            I used to think probability was mainly about guessing outcomes, but as I deepened my understanding—especially through CMSC 57—I realized 
            it’s a logical and structured approach to evaluating uncertainty and risk. While I already had foundational knowledge of probability, 
            learning more concepts and formal probability rules helped me see its broader applications. I’ve become more aware of how probability 
            plays a critical role not just in games, dice, or experiments, but also in areas like algorithms, machine learning, decision-making, and 
            system reliability—key topics in computer science.

        <h2>🎲 Real-Life Example</h2>
        <p>
          Imagine you're applying for a scholarship and there are 100 applicants but only 10 will be chosen. 
          The probability of being selected is <code>10/100 = 0.1</code> or 10%. 
          <br>Understanding this helps you plan better and manage expectations realistically.
          <br><br>
          Understanding this basic probability doesn’t just set realistic expectations—it guides you toward 
          smarter strategies and better-prepared solutions.
