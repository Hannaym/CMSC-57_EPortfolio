        <h2>Graphs...?</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Graphs</b> are structures made up of vertices and edges that represent connections or relationships. They include various types and properties, 
          can be represented in multiple ways, and compared through isomorphism. Graphs help us understand how elements are connected (<i>connectivity</i>), 
          how to find efficient routes (like <i>Euler</i> and <i>Hamiltonian</i> paths, or <i>shortest paths</i>), and how to visualize relationships without 
          overlaps (<i>planar graphs</i>). They are also used in solving problems like scheduling through <i>graph coloring</i>. Overall, graphs are powerful tools for 
          modeling and solving real-world problems especially something involving linked data.

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>
          I used to associate graphs only with visual data representations like bar charts or line graphs in statistics. But through discrete math, 
          I realized that graphs are far more than that—they’re about representing relationships and connections. Whether it's modeling routes, networks, 
          or systems. Graphs offer a powerful and flexible way to understand complex structures. This shift in perspective helped me appreciate how 
          deeply graphs are embedded in real-world applications, especially in fields like computer science, networking, and algorithms.

        <h2>🌐 Real-Life Example</h2>
        <p>
          Think of Google Maps. It uses graphs to show the possible routes and also find the shortest path from one place to another. Each location is a 
          <b>node</b>, and roads are <b>edges</b>. Algorithms like Dijkstra’s help calculate optimal routes.
          <br><br>
          Practical uses of graphs like this demonstrate how abstract concepts can solve real-world problems—turning theory into powerful tools that drive everyday 
          technology.
